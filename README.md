# Caesar 20

A fullstack monorepo of a personal project digitally reimplementing "Caesar!: Seize Rome in 20 Minutes", a board game by Paolo Mori.

Client stack: JS to keep things simple and quick, React because I know it well, Vite because it's fast.

Server stack: TS to help with data management, Koa because it's small, socket.io to learn it.
